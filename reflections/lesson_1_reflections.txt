How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    1. helped by removing extra chars that weren't different to zero in on changes/differences
    2. faster than manually looking at both full docs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    1. Can quickly restore old files that have introduced a bug(s)
    2. Have audit trail of who changed files and when

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    1. Pro: Save in logical "chunks" that make sense
    2. Pro: Can organize changes in more understandable way

    1. Con: Need to remember to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So you get true snapshot of project at any given time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To quickly determine what changed between commits or how much changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Less worry about breaking code or introducing bugs, since can always revert to working/tested base

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A new self project to learn Ember.js
