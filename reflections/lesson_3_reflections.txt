When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with a team that may not work in same physical location; when more than one person working on project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  to ensure you don't overwrite local changes
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks are clones (github clone) but changes only occur in fork an not the original repository, good for working w/
  exisiting code w/o making changes to original
  
  branches are clones or specific snapshot or point in commit history, not the whole repository
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  helps to see all remote changes when offline
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?  

  Directory/File share, VSS or some other version system, multiple copies - github is easier b/c integrates so well with git
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  Anytime you add/work a new feature or work on something that can break master, this way master remains a workable, production ready branch
